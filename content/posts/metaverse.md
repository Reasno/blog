The word Metaverse still bugs me. I have learned the word metadata means the data of data, and the word metaprogramming means the programing of programing (macros, annotations, code generations etc). In Reactive programing I have also seen the word metastream, meaning a stream of streams. Given the word Metaverse, shouldn't it just be the (uni)verse of (uni)verse? In my understanding metaverse, should it exist, can only be found in a higher dimension than the universe we know about. 

Certainly not just video games or VRs. The word subverse is more suitable to them.
