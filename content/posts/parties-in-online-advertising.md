I am going to give a talk highlighting elementary concepts in online advertising. It is a good time to review all the basics.

**Advertiser** Organizations that want to promote a product through different media either directly or through other buyers.

**DSP** Demand-side platforms receive an ad request that they must answer by a time set by the SSP or ad exchange. The time allowed can be as low as 100 ms and range up to a few seconds. DSPs decide whether they want to bid. If they do, they must select an ad, determine a bid price, and return their offer to the ad exchange.

**ADX** A marketplace for advertising that receives ad requests from SSPs. After receiving a request, the SSPs expect to receive ads from all the DSPs with a bid attached before they select the winning bid and return it to the sell side.

**SSP** Supply(sell)-side platforms are sometimes part of an ad server, or they exist as a standalone tool that receives ad requests from publishers or ad servers. SSPs usually send an ad request to the ad exchanges, but sometimes they send this request directly to DSPs.

**DMP** Data management platforms provide additional user information to advertising technology (ad tech) players.

**Trading Desk** Shortened to ATD, agency trading desks buy large inventories of media for the purpose of re-selling it to advertisers

**AdNetworks** An online advertising network or ad network is a company that connects advertisers to websites that want to host advertisements.
